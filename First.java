/* While reading the responsibilities and requirements for the internship, I felt that my skills are best suited for this internship. I am about to finish my second year of college. I have been taught much great information by my professors. I am a quick learner and always think outside of the box to solve any problems with new ideas. I also have worked on some projects that sync with the job description.
 Now it is time for trying my knowledge in some real-world applications. I feel it gives me a distinct advantage over the other candidates as I don't need to start from scratch and require less training. Provided an opportunity, let me show my work rather than speaking more about myself.*/
